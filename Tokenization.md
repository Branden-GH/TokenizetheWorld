# Tokenize The World
![Tokenization](https://theblockbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tokenization.jpg)

Our project involves building a smart contract to create an NFT of the Eifel Tower. We then tokenized the NFT into 100,000 tokens that can be sold to investors. The idea is to allow for a revenue generating asset to be split into pieces and sold to any investor as a token. 


## How it Works
- Once a token is purchased the purchase will be required to hold the token for a period of 12 months.
- The owner of that token will have a percentage ownership of the asset. This is calculated by tokens owned divided by total outstanding tokens.
- The return on investment will be calculated taking the total annual revenue generated by the asset multiplied by your percent ownership. 
- This return on investment will be paid out annualy at the end of the year. 
- Each NFT will be capped at 100,000 available tokens.

## Contract 1 - NFT Creation
- We used ERC 721  and the register land function to create and mint the NFT of our property which creates the token address and token sale address. 

- Use case for ERC721 are real estate or collectibles, where some items are valued more than others, due to their usefulness, rarity, etc. ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, that is, where each token is unique.

## Contract 2 - Wondercoin Sale
- Allows the token to take ownership of our NFT giving value to our tokens.

- ERC20 token is imported into this contract.

- Takes into account how much has been raised, who owns the token, what is the token address, if the cap has been reached. 

- Creates parameters for general public to actually purchase the token

## Contract 3 - Imported WonderCoin contract
- Creates Wonder Sale Token, which then gets minted in the EffielNFT contract.

- Constructor - places requirements of execution.  IE. Payable to wallet, Initialize WonderCoin, Rate, and the Goal to purchase the EiffelNFT.

- ERC-20 - is a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of another Token.

- ERC20Mintable - is a token with a non-fixed total supply, allowing the token issuer to “mint” more tokens whenever they want.

- ERC20 Detailed- is a scripting standard used within the Ethereum blockchain. This dictates a number of rules and actions that an Ethereum token or smart contract must follow.

## Website
- Our website is where investors can see, purchase and sell our tokens.

- We list details such as:
    - Token investments available
    - Token price
    - Investment yield
    - Purchase and sale options

## If we had more time
- Create real interactive website

- Connecting front end to back end

- Adding in rewards system for dividends etc.

- Adding a holding period to prevent premature sales.
